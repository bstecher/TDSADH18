<br>Charles H. Schnelle, secretary of the
<br>House and Real Estate Owners' Association,
<br>says the realty furture of the Yorkville
<br>section is very bright. Along the
<br>route of the Lexington avenue subway
<br>there is need of up-to-date apartment
<br>houses, and there speculative builders
<br>will be able to put up many high class
<br>apartment houses. 
	<p>
<br>Some model houses of this class are under 
<br>way in this section.
	<p>
<br>"Realty in the section has been considerably 
<br>benefited by the building of the 
<br>Queensboro Bridge," says Mr. Schnelle, 
<br>"and if plans for the bridge to span the 
<br>Hudson River are carried out Yorkville 
<br>will have two spendid river highways 
<br>connecting the New Jersey and the Long 
<br>Island shoes. It is impossible to estimate 
<br>accurately the manifold benefits 
<br>which such connections will bring to this 
<br>great section of the city. The more we 
<br>are brought in closer touch with suburban 
<br>New Jersey and Long Island the greater 
<br>will be the realty vigor of the old 
<br>Yorkville section.
	<p>
<br>"The Lexington avenue spur of the subway 
<br>is expected to stimulate realty buying 
<br>in a much larger degree than in recent 
<br>years throughout the entire section. 
<br>The subway places the great theatrical 
<br>and shopping centres of Manhattan on a  
<br>direct line with the Yorkville district.  
<br>Besides, the subway will make it possible  
<br>for hundreds of families living in the  
<br>Yorkville flathouse sections to more quickly  
<br>reach to various flourishing centres  
<br>of upper New York, especially in The  
<br>Bronx.
	 <p>
<br>"Within recent years the upper Park  
<br>avenue section, which is one of the most  
<br>delightful residential parts of Yorkville,  
<br>has undergone a big transformation. It  
<br>has been changed from an inaccessible  
<br>dwelling house region into one of the  
<br>strongest and most populat apartment  
<br>house areas of the greater city.
	<p>
<br>"Its development along these lines is  
<br>just in the initial stage, and when the  
<br>Lexington avenue subway is in operation  
<br>it will be superbly located as a place of  
<br>residence. For years it suffered from the  
<br>noise and smoke nuisance of the old Park  
<br>avenue tunnel. But with the changing  
<br>of the motive power of the trains using  
<br>the tunnel from steam to electricity the  
<br>smoke and noise nuisance was removed.
	<p>
<br>"What is needed, and it may not be  
<br>very long before it becomes a reality,  
<br>is a crosstown subway between the East  
<br>River and the West Side. Except at the  
<br>two extreme ends of Yorkville, or on 86th  
<br>street, where there is a trolley service to  
<br>Eighth avenue, there is no direct connection 
<br> with the West Side. With this proposed  
<br>subway to connect the two main 
<br> lines of Lexington avenue and Broadway  
<br>wonderful improvements could be expected.  
<br>A practical solution has already been  
<br>presented to the Public Service Commission  
<br>in a plan to create a loop beginning  
<br>at the Battery, to run up Lexington avenue  
<br>to 86th steet, and through 86th street  
<br>and Central Park, then down Broadway,  
<br>giving this section a local as well as an  
<br>express service and to all points further  
<br>uptown.
	<p>
<br>"With these improvement (and all are  
<br>practical) carried out, great future  
<br>possibilities can be expected from this  
<br>section.
	<p>
<br>"Investors and builders will do well to  
<br>consider the future of this, one of the  
<br>safest and most steady sections of this  
<br>great city.
	<p>
<br>"Yorkville is an historic district. When  
<br>New York began to grow rapidly northward  
<br>from the old Knickerbocker districts  
<br>many of the well-to-do families sought a  
<br>suitable place for a summer home on  
<br>Manhattan Island. At that time no section  
<br>offered more rural advantages than  
<br>Yorkville.
	<p>
<br>"The district is bounded by Fifth avenue  
<br>and the East River, 57th and 100th  
<br>streets, and was traversed years ago by  
<br>the old Boston Post Road, now Third avenue.  
<br>The Boston Road was one of the  
<br>principal thoroughfares running north  
<br>and south throughout the entire length  
<br>of Manhattan Island.
	<p>
<br>"As a result of the growth, both in a  
<br>business and residential way, in the lower
